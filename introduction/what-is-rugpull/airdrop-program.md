# Airdrop Program

## **1. Purpose of the Airdrop**

The RugPull Airdrop Program is created to reward users who supported the platform during its early stages. These early participants helped test the staking system, provided feedback, contributed to community discussions, or expanded the network through referrals. Instead of relying on hype or inflated incentives, RugPull distributes tokens in a structured and transparent way to acknowledge real engagement.

The airdrop is also designed to align long-term incentives. Token distribution to early users builds a community of holders who understand the platform and have a reason to stay involved—whether through staking, governance, or future ecosystem activities. The purpose is not short-term speculation but strengthening the foundation of RugPull’s user base.

## **2. Allocation and Eligibility**

A fixed portion of the RugPull token supply is dedicated to Airdrop Program One. Allocation focuses on three groups that contributed meaningfully to the platform:

* **Early Stakers:** Users who opened and maintained staking positions before the snapshot. Rewards scale based on staking duration and consistency, not just amount staked.
* **Referral Contributors:** Users who invited new participants who actually staked. Only verified staking activity counts, ensuring fairness and discouraging farming.
* **Community Supporters:** Individuals who provided feedback, participated in early testing, or helped improve RugPull during development.

Eligibility is determined by a snapshot of staking positions, wallet connections, and referral data. Only the wallet used during the snapshot is valid for claiming. The claim process is simple: connect the same wallet to the RugPull dashboard and complete a gas-only transaction. No one from RugPull will ever ask for private keys or request tokens as part of the process.

## **3. Claiming Process and Long-Term Role**

During the claim window, eligible users can view and claim their allocation directly from the official RugPull dashboard. If tokens are not claimed before the deadline, they may be returned to the treasury for future reward programs or community initiatives.

The airdrop plays a long-term role in shaping the RugPull ecosystem. Holders who receive allocations can stake their tokens for additional rewards, participate in governance, and influence future decisions such as staking parameters, APR adjustments, and treasury usage. This ensures the early community remains closely connected to the development of the protocol.
