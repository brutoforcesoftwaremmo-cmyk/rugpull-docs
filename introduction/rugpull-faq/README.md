# RugPull FAQ

<details>

<summary>What is RugPull?</summary>

RugPull is a simplified and transparent staking platform built on BNB Chain. Instead of overwhelming users with complex DeFi mechanics, RugPull focuses on offering fixed-term yield options that are easy to understand. The goal is to make staking accessible to everyday users by providing predictable returns, a clean interface, and clear explanations of how each staking option works.

<summary>Why does RugPull exist?</summary>

Many DeFi platforms suffer from overly complex features, inconsistent user experiences, and unrealistic reward promises. This creates confusion and unnecessary risks for new users. RugPull was created to solve these issues by offering a straightforward staking system with stable APR, clear terms, and transparent reward calculations. It prioritizes safety, simplicity, and long-term sustainability rather than chasing hype.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does RugPull work?</summary>

RugPull uses smart contracts on BNB Chain to manage staking positions. When a user connects their wallet and chooses a staking term, the contract locks the user’s tokens for that period and starts generating rewards automatically. Rewards are calculated based on the APR attached to that term. The dashboard then displays the user’s active positions, total rewards, and historical activity in real time.

<details>

<summary>Is RugPull safe to use?</summary>

RugPull is **non-custodial**, meaning it never holds user funds. All actions—staking, claiming rewards, withdrawing—are processed via the user’s own wallet. Smart contracts use established libraries from trusted sources and undergo continuous review. While no protocol is 100% risk-free, RugPull is designed around simplicity and minimal attack surfaces to reduce risk as much as possible.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What blockchain does RugPull run on?</summary>

RugPull operates on **BNB Chain**, chosen because of its low transaction fees, high performance, and wide range of supported Web3 wallets. This allows users to stake and claim rewards with minimal cost and fast confirmations.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What tokens can I stake?</summary>

RugPull supports selected tokens from the BNB Chain ecosystem. These tokens are chosen based on liquidity, user demand, and security considerations. As the platform grows, additional tokens may be introduced after evaluation by the development and risk teams.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are staking rewards calculated?</summary>

Each staking term has a fixed APR. The system calculates rewards continuously based on the user’s locked amount and chosen duration. Longer terms provide higher APR because they offer more stability to the protocol. All calculations are displayed clearly so users always understand how much they are earning and why.

</details>

<details>

<summary>When can I claim my rewards?</summary>

Users can claim rewards at any moment unless their chosen term has specific restrictions. Reward claiming does not require unstaking the original principal. After claiming, rewards are transferred directly to the user's wallet or can be used for restaking depending on platform features.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is KYC required to use RugPull?</summary>

No. RugPull does not require KYC or personal identity verification. Users only need a Web3 wallet. This ensures privacy and keeps the platform accessible globally, except in regions restricted by regulation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I use multiple wallets?</summary>

Yes. Users can stake across multiple wallets if they prefer to separate their holdings. Each wallet operates independently, maintaining its own staking positions, reward history, and referral data.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do referrals work?</summary>

Each user receives a unique referral code. When someone registers or stakes using that code, the referrer earns a percentage of the referred user’s staking rewards or receives bonus points, depending on the current program. RugPull ensures referrals are fair by only rewarding legitimate activity rather than inflated numbers or bot-generated traffic.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does RugPull have a native token?</summary>

Yes. The RugPull token is the central asset used for governance, incentive alignment, and certain protocol-level utilities. It is not required to stake external tokens, but holding RugPull can unlock additional benefits such as enhanced rewards or eligibility for exclusive features.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the purpose of the RugPull token?</summary>

The token is designed to support **governance**, **ecosystem incentives**, **treasury operations**, and potential **security mechanisms** such as future validator/staking roles. It aligns the protocol’s long-term growth with community participation, ensuring users have influence over how the system evolves.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is the RugPull token distributed?</summary>

The token supply is allocated across several categories:

* Staking reward emissions
* Community airdrops
* Ecosystem and development funding
* Liquidity support
* Team and advisors (with strict vesting)

This allocation is designed to sustain the platform long-term while rewarding early participants fairly.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does staking lock my funds?</summary>

Only if you choose a fixed-term staking option. These terms lock the principal for a predetermined duration to provide predictable APR. If you prefer flexibility, there are options with no lockup, allowing withdrawal at any time.
