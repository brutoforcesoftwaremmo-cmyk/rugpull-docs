# RugPull Staking FAQ

<details>

<summary>What resources are required to stake on RugPull?</summary>

Staking on RugPull requires only a supported Web3 wallet and a small amount of BNB for gas fees. There is no need for hardware devices, servers, or constant uptime. Users simply choose a staking term and lock their tokens through the smart contract. All reward tracking and yield computation are handled automatically by the protocol.

<details>

<summary>What does staking actually do on RugPull?</summary>

When users stake tokens, the smart contract locks their funds for the selected duration and begins generating rewards based on the APR of that term. Staking contributes to platform stability, allows RugPull to implement predictable reward schedules, and helps build long-term liquidity for supported assets.

<details>

<summary>What are the benefits of staking on RugPull?</summary>

Users receive predictable yields, transparent APR, and the ability to track all positions through a clean dashboard. RugPull removes the complexity normally associated with DeFi, eliminating hidden fees, confusing APY calculations, and unstable reward farming. Additionally, stakers gain priority access to future airdrops and feature releases.

<details>

<summary>How does staking on RugPull compare to traditional DeFi staking?</summary>

Traditional DeFi staking often requires interacting with multiple protocols, bridging assets, understanding complex incentives, and monitoring volatile APY changes. RugPull simplifies the entire process with fixed-term staking, clear APR, low transaction fees, and a unified dashboard. It is designed for users who want predictable rewards without constant management.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the cost of staking on RugPull?</summary>

The only unavoidable cost is blockchain gas fees for staking and claiming rewards. RugPull does not charge additional platform fees unless a specific staking term includes an early-withdrawal penalty. All costs are shown transparently before the user confirms the transaction.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the projected reward rate for RugPull staking?</summary>

Reward rates depend on platform parameters and staking duration. Longer terms generally offer higher APR due to increased stability for the protocol. APR remains transparent and predictable so users always know what they will earn before staking.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can one RugPull account stake from multiple wallets?</summary>

Yes. RugPull does not enforce account-level restrictions. Users can stake from any number of wallets, and each wallet operates independently with its own positions and rewards. Users who prefer to separate wallets for security or organisation reasons may do so freely.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Does staking generate heat or require my device to stay online?</summary>

No. Staking on RugPull does not require hardware resources like mining or running nodes. Your device can be turned off completely after staking. All operations occur on-chain, and the smart contract continues generating rewards automatically.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How secure is staking on RugPull?</summary>

RugPull uses non-custodial smart contracts, meaning tokens remain fully controlled by users until they explicitly approve transactions. The protocol uses audited libraries and conservative contract design. No staking mechanism is risk-free, but RugPull minimizes risk by keeping logic simple and transparent.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I stake again while having active positions?</summary>

Yes. Users can open multiple staking positions with different amounts and terms. The dashboard will track each position separately so users can diversify between short-term and long-term yields depending on their goals.

Grasshopper only uses the internet you're not already using, so it won’t slow down your browsing, streaming, or gaming. It also dials things back automatically if your network is busy. It never touches your private data — just safely relays Grass network traffic in the background.
