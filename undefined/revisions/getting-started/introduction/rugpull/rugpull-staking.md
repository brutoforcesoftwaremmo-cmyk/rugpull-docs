# RugPull Staking

Staking on RugPull allows users to contribute to the security and stability of the platform while earning predictable, fixed-term rewards. All staking is non-custodial—your assets remain in your wallet until you sign a transaction to lock them into a smart contract.

By staking your RugPull tokens, you help maintain the economic strength of the network and receive rewards in return.

### **How Staking Works**

RugPull uses a **fixed-term staking model**, where users choose a predefined lock duration (e.g., 30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days). Rewards accrue continuously throughout the entire staking period based on the term’s APR.

There is:

* **No minimum stake amount** (unless specified by a pool)
* **No hidden fees**
* **No requirement to remain online**

Once the stake is confirmed on-chain, rewards begin accumulating automatically.

If a user decides to withdraw early (when allowed), reduced rewards or early-withdrawal penalties may apply depending on the term chosen.

### **Delegated Staking Model**

In addition to standard fixed-term staking, RugPull may support **delegated staking**, where users contribute stake to network operators responsible for routing, validation, or infrastructure operations.

This model follows a **shared-risk, shared-reward** principle:

* Delegators provide stake
* Operators perform network duties
* Rewards are shared proportionally

Delegated staking ensures incentives stay aligned between users and operators, creating a more secure and reliable system.

***

### **Operator Selection and Reward Distribution**

Once the system transitions toward decentralization, delegators will be able to choose specific operators based on:

* Uptime performance
* Reliability history
* Commission rates
* Track record within the network

Operators with more delegated stake are generally selected more frequently for network tasks.\
This increased activity generates higher rewards, which are then shared between operators and their delegators according to predefined ratios.

***

### **Commission Structure**

Operators incur infrastructure costs, so they charge a commission on the rewards generated.\
Commission models vary but typically include:

* A fixed percentage deducted from rewards
* Transparent, on-chain reporting of fees
* Dynamic adjustments as operators compete in the open market

Users should always review:

* Commission rates
* Operator uptime
* Performance history

…before delegating to maximize returns and minimize risk.

***

### **Unstaking Process**

If a staking pool includes an unstaking delay, users must wait through this period before withdrawing their tokens.\
For example:

* Initiating an unstake triggers a **lock period** (such as 7 days)
* Tokens cannot be transferred or restaked during this time
* Once the lock expires, tokens become fully withdrawable

This mechanism protects network stability and prevents rapid liquidity swings.

***

### **Slashing — Future Risk Consideration**

Slashing is **not currently active** on RugPull.\
However, as the ecosystem evolves, the protocol may introduce slashing to discourage malicious or negligent operator behavior.

Slashing would apply if an operator:

* Submits invalid or fraudulent transactions
* Misreports data
* Attempts to censor participants or manipulate routing
* Violates protocol rules

If implemented, slashing would permanently destroy a portion of the operator’s stake (and potentially a proportional amount from delegators, depending on the system design).

Users should remain aware of this potential future risk when choosing delegation strategies.

***

### **Summary**

Staking on RugPull is designed to be:

* **Simple** — clear terms, transparent APR, predictable rewards
* **Secure** — non-custodial, on-chain, user-controlled
* **Flexible** — multiple term lengths and optional delegation
* **Sustainable** — aligned incentives for long-term network health

As the network grows, staking will continue to be a key mechanism for participation, reward generation, and ecosystem governance.
