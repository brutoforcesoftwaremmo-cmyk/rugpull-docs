# Getting Started

## **Getting Started**

### **Overview**

RugPull is designed to make staking simple, transparent, and accessible to everyone. Instead of complicated DeFi strategies or unpredictable APY models, RugPull focuses on offering fixed-term staking with clear rewards, intuitive UX, and full on-chain transparency.\
Whether you're new to Web3 or an experienced user, RugPull gives you a predictable way to earn yield while always maintaining full control over your assets.

RugPull consists of two main components:

#### **1. The RugPull dApp**

The RugPull app allows users to connect their EVM wallet, choose a staking term, and start earning rewards instantly.\
There are no accounts, no emails, and no passwords — **your wallet is your identity**.\
The dApp provides:

* Real-time reward tracking
* A clear dashboard for all positions
* A simple staking and claiming flow
* Referral tracking and optional airdrop participation

#### **2. The RugPull Protocol Layer**

Under the hood, RugPull operates through a set of contracts and infrastructure that powers the entire staking ecosystem. This includes:

* Smart contracts that manage deposits, lock periods, and reward distribution
* A backend indexer that tracks user activity and provides analytics
* Governance and token-based decision-making mechanisms
* A reward engine that ensures predictable and transparent APR

Together, these components create a predictable and sustainable yield system—without unnecessary complexity.
