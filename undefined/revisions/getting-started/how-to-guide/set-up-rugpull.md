# Set Up RugPull

### **How RugPull Works Behind the Scenes**

When you stake on RugPull, your tokens are locked directly in a smart contract.\
RugPull does **not**:

* View your wallet activity
* Control your assets
* Request private keys
* Access your device data

The platform only reads the **public wallet address** you approve, and uses it to load your staking data and reward history.

All earnings, withdrawals, and claims remain fully on-chain and verifiable.

### **Steps to Start Using RugPull**

#### **1. Connect Your Wallet**

Use any supported EVM wallet:

* MetaMask
* Trust Wallet
* Rabby
* WalletConnect-compatible wallets

No email, no password, no account creation.\
Your wallet **is** your identity.

After connecting, RugPull will automatically load:

* Your staking positions
* Claimable rewards
* Referral status
* Dashboard metrics

***

#### **2. Select a Staking Term**

Choose a token and pick one of the available fixed-term pools (30 / 60 / 90 / 180 / 365 days).

Each term displays:

* APR
* Lockup period
* Estimated rewards
* Rules for early withdrawal

Everything is transparent and easy to understand.

***

#### **3. Start Earning**

Confirm the stake with one wallet signature.

Once confirmed, RugPull:

* Locks your tokens via smart contract
* Starts reward accumulation instantly
* Updates your dashboard in real time

You can sit back, relax, and return anytime to:

* Claim accumulated rewards
* Create new stakes
* Track your portfolio performance

RugPull runs fully on-chain — **no background app, no device uptime required.**
