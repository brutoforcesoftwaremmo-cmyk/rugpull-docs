# Set up RugPull

## **Steps to start using RugPull**

#### **1. Connect your wallet**

Sign in with a supported EVM wallet such as MetaMask.\
No account creation or email required — your wallet is your identity.

***

#### **2. Select a staking term**

Choose a token and a fixed duration (e.g., 30, 60, 90, 180, or 365 days).\
Each term clearly displays its APR, lockup period, and expected reward model.

***

#### **3. Confirm your stake**

Sign the transaction from your wallet.\
RugPull will automatically register your position and start accumulating rewards.

That’s it — once staked, your dashboard will show your active positions, claimable rewards, and total earnings in real time.

RugPull runs in the background while your positions earn yield. You can return at any time to claim rewards or open new stakes.
