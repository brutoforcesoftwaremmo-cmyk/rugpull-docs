### **Steps to Start Using RugPull**

#### **1. Connect Your Wallet**

To begin, connect a supported EVM wallet such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or Rabby.\
RugPull does not require email, phone number, or account creation — **your wallet is your identity**.\
Once connected, the platform will automatically detect your address and load all related staking data.

***

#### **2. Choose a Staking Term**

Select a token you want to stake and pick one of the available fixed-duration terms (30, 60, 90, 180, or 365 days).\
Each term clearly displays:

* APR (annual percentage rate)
* Lockup duration
* Expected rewards
* Rules for early withdrawal (if applicable)

RugPull is designed so users always know exactly what they are committing to — no hidden conditions, no confusing APYs.

#### **3. Confirm Your Stake**

When you're ready, simply sign the transaction in your wallet.\
RugPull will:

* Lock your tokens securely through a smart contract
* Register your position instantly

You don’t need to keep your device online — **everything runs automatically on-chain**.

***

#### **4. Track Your Earnings**

Your personal dashboard will show:

* Active staking positions
* Claimable rewards
* Total earnings
* History of stakes, claims, and withdrawals

Rewards accumulate continuously, and you can return at any time to claim them or open new positions.

#### **5. Manage Your Stakes**

Depending on the term you choose, you may:

* Claim rewards anytime
* Unstake at maturity with full yield
* Unstake early (if allowed) with a reduced reward or fee
* Restake claimed rewards to compound returns

RugPull is designed to keep the entire experience simple, predictable, and transparent.
