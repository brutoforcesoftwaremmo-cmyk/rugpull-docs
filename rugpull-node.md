# RugPull Node

### **1. Overview**

RugPull Nodes are extremely lightweight and free to run.\
They function as the **network’s gateway to the internet**, allowing the protocol to:

* Relay authorized web requests generated by RugPull clients
* Return encrypted server responses to the router layer
* Expand global coverage and reduce latency
* Provide redundancy and stability

Node operators (users running the node app) earn rewards proportional to the amount of traffic relayed through their device and their node’s reputation.

Nodes do **not** access private data from the user’s device — they simply use the available bandwidth to route public web requests.

### **2. Running a Node**

Running a RugPull Node is designed to be simple and accessible.

#### **How to Start**

1. **Download the RugPull Node App**\
   Available for desktop systems (mobile coming later).
2. **Install & Launch**\
   The app runs quietly in the background with minimal resource usage.
3. **Connect to the Network**\
   Once connected, your device automatically registers as an active node.

No configuration required, no advanced setup, and no technical knowledge needed.

#### **Supported Systems**

RugPull intends to support:

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux\
  (Additional systems will be added as the network grows.)

### **3. Node Operation**

Once online, a RugPull Node begins participating instantly.

#### **3.1 Traffic Handling**

Each incoming request is:

* Delivered as an **encrypted packet**
* Containing only routing instructions (destination)
* Verified with digital signatures from all protocol components

The node cannot see the content of the request. Its job is simply to pass packets to public web servers and return responses through the secure circuit.

#### **3.2 Full-Circuit Encryption**

Every request is protected by layered encryption that guarantees:

* No tampering
* No forged packets
* No visibility into the data being relayed
* Integrity of end-to-end routing

This secure design allows validators to measure node performance accurately without compromising user privacy.

### **4. Node Reputation Scoring**

Each node receives a reputation score based on operational quality:

* **Completeness** – Whether the data returned is whole and intact
* **Consistency** – Whether the node performs reliably across different sessions
* **Timeliness** – How quickly the node responds to network tasks
* **Availability** – Uptime and ability to stay connected

Nodes with higher scores receive:

* More traffic
* Better rewards
* Greater priority in task assignment

(For detailed scoring models, see the RugPull Reputation page.)

### **5. Privacy & Security**

RugPull Nodes are built with strict privacy protection.

* The network **cannot access your personal files or activity**
* The node **cannot view or modify the content** of the requests
* Only **public web data** is accessed
* All communication is cryptographically authenticated
* Your device remains isolated from actual request content

The system uses your **bandwidth**, not your personal information.
