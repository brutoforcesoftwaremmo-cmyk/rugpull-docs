# Getting Started | RugPull

RugPull is built with the goal of simplifying on-chain staking and making yield opportunities more transparent and accessible. Instead of relying on complicated interfaces or unrealistic return models, RugPull provides a clear set of fixed staking terms, predictable APR, and a user-friendly experience designed for both newcomers and experienced users.

The RugPull ecosystem is made up of two primary components:

**1. RugPull dApp** – a web-based application where users can connect their wallet, choose a staking term, track rewards in real time, and manage their positions through a clean and understandable interface.

**2. RugPull Backend & Smart Contracts** – the backend manages user records, platform logic, referrals, and airdrop campaigns, while smart contracts on BNB Chain securely handle token transfers, staking positions, and reward distribution. Users stay in full control of their assets at all times.

If you’re new to RugPull, the best place to start is by exploring how staking terms work and understanding the yield structure so you can make informed decisions.
